# ToDoList
The app works to list out the tasks for day to day basis.

The user can be able to perform following functionalities:

1. User can view the list of tasks
2. User can add new tasks to the list
3. When the user feels the task is completed, he can tap on the task to mark it checked.
4. When the user feels there is still some fine tuning left for the task, he can tap again to the checked task to mark it unchecked.
